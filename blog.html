This first assignment was fairly easy; everything we needed to know for the assignment we
learned in class well before the due date; nothing really confused me besides
getting used to using Git and Github at the beginning. The only other thing that
tripped me up for a while was publishing and getting the image onto the page.

This assignment also made me set up the VPN to get to the Engineering servers from home,
so that was something useful it had me end up doing. The most helpful resources were public
sources that explained how to use different tags, since I was a little ahead of where
we were in class.

  ASSIGNMENT 1
4/8/2020
This first assignment was fairly easy; everything we needed to know for the assignment we
learned in class well before the due date; nothing really confused me besides
getting used to using Git and Github at the beginning. The only other thing that
tripped me up for a while was publishing and getting the image onto the page.

This assignment also made me set up the VPN to get to the Engineering servers from home,
so that was something useful it had me end up doing. The most helpful resources were public
sources that explained how to use different tags, since I was a little ahead of where
we were in class.

ASSIGNMENT 2
4/25/2020
This second assignment was a lot more difficult. I had struggled keeping up with the class
when we began learning CSS implementation; so I didn't know some of the things that were essential
to styling the webpage.
What gave me difficulties:
<br>
1. Making the horizontal list for the Home/Trending/People stumped me for days until I found
implementation that made sense to me.
<br>
2. Aligning things in general was tricky.
<br>
3. Getting the twit author names to align took a bit.
<br>
So what I learned from this assignment was that I was missing a lot of essential knowledge
for CSS. And I then had to learn it back on my own.<br>
The Piazza form and the W3schools were helpful, with special mention going to itnext.io
for my navbar implementation.<br>
Things I googled: flexbox, align text, navbar css, a whole lot of other things

  ASSIGNMENT 1
4/8/2020
This first assignment was fairly easy; everything we needed to know for the assignment we
learned in class well before the due date; nothing really confused me besides
getting used to using Git and Github at the beginning. The only other thing that
tripped me up for a while was publishing and getting the image onto the page.

This assignment also made me set up the VPN to get to the Engineering servers from home,
so that was something useful it had me end up doing. The most helpful resources were public
sources that explained how to use different tags, since I was a little ahead of where
we were in class.

ASSIGNMENT 2
4/25/2020
This second assignment was a lot more difficult. I had struggled keeping up with the class
when we began learning CSS implementation; so I didn't know some of the things that were essential
to styling the webpage.
What gave me difficulties:
<br>
1. Making the horizontal list for the Home/Trending/People stumped me for days until I found
implementation that made sense to me.
<br>
2. Aligning things in general was tricky.
<br>
3. Getting the twit author names to align took a bit.
<br>
So what I learned from this assignment was that I was missing a lot of essential knowledge
for CSS. And I then had to learn it back on my own.<br>
The Piazza form and the W3schools were helpful, with special mention going to itnext.io
for my navbar implementation.<br>
Things I googled: flexbox, align text, navbar css, a whole lot of other things

ASSIGNMENT 3
5/11/2020
<br>
The third assignment! Tricky at first, then it all clicked for me and it was smooth sailing. Once again, I
was lax in paying attention in lecture and had to basically learn it again on my own.
<br>
What gave me difficulties:
<br>
1. The whole JS-HTML interfacing with DOMs. Once I got that figured out it was smooth sailing
<br>
2. Deleting elements using JS. Didn't actually figure that out or get it working, so I settled for hiding stuff (sorry!).
<br>
3. Manually having to set the styles of the objects made in JS wasn't hard, but it was tedious. A dedicated function
would be better in the future. There's probably a function to copy over a style set that I don't know about.
<br>
So what I learned was I was missing a bit of essential JS knowledge, but I learned it quickly.<br>
Big resources: Piazza for a few cases, the lecture notes and jsfiddle examples along with lecture code. I googled surprisngly
little things for this too.

  ASSIGNMENT 4
  5/18/2020
  <br>
  The fourth assignment. Easy as soon as I figured it out, but frustrating to figure out. Node.js felt a lot more impenetrable to me at first, and it didn't help that I had trouble understanding
  the lecture notes.
  <br>
  The biggest problem I ran into was displaying the pages of data; as soon as I figured that out, the assignment was basically over.
  <br>
  I learned basic node.js implementation, but I still don't really know how it works.
  <br>
  I used some piazza and googled the rest of my questions. Lecture notes came less in handy this time. I specifically googled "node.js display html page" several times.

  ASSIGNMENT 5
  6/2/2020
  <br>
  Final (non-group) assignment! Frustrating for a while, then it all fell into place. Handlebars is easy to use once you get it figured out, and express is the same way.
<br>
Biggest problem I ran into was getting the server to actually see my templates. After that, everything worked smoothly.
<br>
I learned handlebars, express and more usage of node, which I can all see good uses for in the future.
<br>
I used the piazza forum and lecture notes the most; they were the simplest resource available to me, and broke things down better than random StackOverflow threads.<br>
I also used the example code for reference a lot. 
<br>
What I googled the most: how to get handlebars to see my templates.
